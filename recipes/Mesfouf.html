    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Mesfouf is a light couscous-based dish that's especially popular during Ramadan and festive occasions.</p>
    <p>Unlike regular couscous served with stew, Mesfouf is often enjoyed on its own, either sweet (with raisins, dates, and sugar) or savory (with peas, beans, or even buttermilk).</p>
    <p>In this article, we will be covering the savory version only, as it is the author's personal favorite.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups couscous</li>
        <li>1 cup peas or fava beans (steamed or pre-cooked)</li>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil or smen</li>
        <li>Salt, pepper</li>
        <li>Buttermilk or laban (served on the side)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Steam the couscous using a couscoussier or a steamer: 
            <ul>
                <li>Moisten couscous with a bit of water and a pinch of salt.</li>
                <li>Steam for about 20 minutes, fluff with butter, and repeat the process 1â€“2 times for fluffiness.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Mix with cooked vegetables, olive oil, and season to taste.</li>
        <li>Serve with a glass of buttermilk or a bowl of laban for a light, refreshing meal.</li>
    </ol>
