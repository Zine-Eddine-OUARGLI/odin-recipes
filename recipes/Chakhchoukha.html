    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chakhchoukha (also spelled Chakhchouka or Chekhchoukha) is a traditional North African dish, particularly popular in Algeria. It’s a rich and hearty meal that combines torn flatbread with a fragrant, spiced meat and vegetable stew.</p>
    <p>The name comes from the verb "chakhchoukha", meaning "to tear into small pieces", referring to the preparation of the bread. There are regional variations, with the most well-known being Chakhchoukha Constantinoise and Chakhchoukha Biskria.</p>

        <li>Water or broth (enough to cover the ingredients)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps to make it:</h2>
    <h3>1. Make the Flatbread (Rougag):</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix semolina, flour, and salt.</li>
        <li>Gradually add water and knead until you get a smooth, elastic dough.</li>
        <li>Let rest for 15–30 minutes covered.</li>
        <li>Divide into small balls, roll each one thin (like a tortilla), and cook on a hot dry skillet or griddle until lightly golden and cooked through.</li>
        <li>Stack the breads, and once cool, tear or cut them into small bite-sized pieces (like squares or rough strips). Set aside.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>2. Prepare the Stew:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large pot or tagine. Brown the meat on all sides.</li>
        <li>Add chopped onion and garlic. Sauté until translucent.</li>
        <li>Stir in spices and tomato paste, then add the chopped tomatoes. Cook for a few minutes until tomatoes break down.</li>
        <li>Add chickpeas, carrots, and enough water or broth to cover.</li>
        <li>Simmer for about 45 minutes to 1 hour, until meat is tender.</li>
        <li>Add zucchini in the last 15 minutes of cooking so they don’t overcook.</li>
        <li>Adjust seasoning and let the sauce thicken slightly.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>3. Assemble the Dish:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Just before serving, place the torn flatbread into a large serving dish.</li>
        <li>Ladle the hot stew over the bread and mix well, allowing the bread to absorb the sauce.</li>
        <li>Let it sit covered for 5–10 minutes so everything melds together.</li>
        <li>Serve hot, garnished with fresh parsley or coriander if desired.</li>
    </ol>
